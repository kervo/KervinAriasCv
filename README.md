User Centric Milestone project for the Code Institute
============================

This project is designed to accomplish the concepts learned up to the User Centric module for the Code Institute.

My name is Kervin Arias and Iâ€™m presenting here my personal portfolio with recent work samples and also my vision about design and art in a little mockup for a blog section. The name of my site is Kervo Solutions as this has been my title as a free-lance graphic designer for over 10 years.

UX
============================

The main goal of my site is to have an easy route for potential recruiters/employers to download my cv and browse samples of my work.

Image gallery with samples of my work can be find at the bottom close to the footer. I decided to showcase my work in all pages, first to fill up the bottom space with something useful and secondly to attract the traffic to my work/skills section.

> The aim of my blog is to ask the questions: Why design and art are important for me?, How can I be a better graphic designer?

Technologies
=============================

Visual Studio Code
Boostrap
Github
Google Chrome
Adobe XD
Adobe Illustrator
Adobe Photoshop

Testing
===========

Google Chrome to verify that the site is responsive and to fix margings or paddings.

>Fixing footer links: I had a problem with the alignment of my footer because I wanted to divide it in 3 sections. When I stood back and see that two sections were built with `ul` I decided to leave them in one section with a `col-4` width and the copyright on the left as it's a longer line `col-8` then another problem came; links on the right don't look well.

Finally after this problem arrived I understood the use of `float: right;`





Features
==========

* Hamburger menu: I wanted to keep my heading clean and most users are familiar with this triagram icon to navigate through the page.

* CV download: Easy way to access my cv and download a PDF file.
