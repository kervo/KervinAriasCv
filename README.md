User Centric Milestone project for the Code Institute
============================

This project is designed to accomplish the concepts learned up to the User Centric module for the Code Institute.

My name is Kervin Arias and Iâ€™m presenting here my personal portfolio with recent work samples and also my vision about design and art in a little mockup for a blog section. The name of my site is Kervo Solutions as this has been my title as a freelance graphic designer for over 10 years.

UX
============================

The main goal of my site is to have an easy route for potential recruiters/employers to download my cv and browse samples of my work.

Image gallery with samples of my work can be find at the bottom close to the footer. I decided to showcase my work in all pages, first to fill up the bottom space with something useful and secondly to attract the traffic to my work or skills sections.

> The aim of my blog is to ask the questions: Why design and art are important for me?, How can I be a better graphic designer?

## Skills Page

## CV / Work

## Contact Page
With a form to send me an email.

Features
==========

* Hamburger menu: I wanted to keep my heading clean and most users are familiar with this triagram icon to navigate through the page.

* CV download: Easy way to access my cv and download a PDF file.

## Work/Skills Timeline

My class timeline is based on (http://bestjquery.com/tutorial/timeline/demo72/#) I didn't copy the code, I just used to guide my design and to challenge myself to get it as close as posible.



Technologies
=============================

Visual Studio Code
Boostrap
Github
Google Chrome
Adobe XD
Adobe Illustrator
Adobe Photoshop

Testing
===========

Google Chrome to verify that the site is responsive and to fix margings or paddings. My first section was causing horizontal scroll and the simple answer was to place my `row` into a `conatiner` to discover and debug the problem I used (https://blog.wernull.com/2013/04/debug-ghost-css-elements-causing-unwanted-scrolling/)

>Fixing footer links: I had a problem with the alignment of my footer because I wanted to divide it in 3 sections. When I stood back and see that two sections were built with `ul` I decided to leave them in one section with a `col-4` width and the copyright on the left as it's a longer line `col-8` then another problem came; links on the right don't look well.

Finally after this problem arrived I understood the use of `float: right;`

### Contact Page

During my testing `textarea` not showing correctly so I added `cols` attribute to change the default size to 30. It didn't work but I found some useful information here (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30164301/css-width100-textarea-for-comment-responsive/30164488) by keepping the width to 100%, `textarea` takes all the space available for the contact form.

### Skills Page

When I switched to mobile mode to see the sections, `<i> icons` were showing big and pushing `<p>` to a narrow space, I added a breaking point for mobile ```@media screen and (max-width:567px)``` 


Deployment
=================

I created a repository on Github and use the guide to set up a branch by adding the origin master.

After that, I used the terminal on Visual Studio Code to link the two folders with the following steps:

* Stablish a connection in between the two folders `git init` 

* Adding all files that have been changed `git add .` and to verify what I was sending `git status`

* Ready to send the files `git commit -m "message"`

* Open the remote connection in between the two folders `git pull origin master`

* Update the files on the repository `git push origin master`
